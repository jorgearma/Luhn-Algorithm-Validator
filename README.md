# Luhn-Algorithm-Validator

## Purpose of This Script

This script serves educational purposes by:

- Providing an understanding of the implementation of the Luhn algorithm in Python.
- Demonstrating fundamental scripting techniques in Python.
- Teaching how to handle string operations and mathematical calculations effectively in Python.

The script focuses on validating credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm, which is a checksum formula used for various identification numbers, particularly credit card numbers. It aims to help learners grasp Python scripting concepts through practical application and algorithm implementation.

Feel free to explore and modify the script for learning purposes. For real-world applications involving credit card data, ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.

## Overview

The `luhn_check` function implemented in this Python script verifies the validity of credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. This script is intended for educational purposes, aimed at understanding Python scripting and the mechanics of the Luhn algorithm.

## Luhn Algorithm Explanation

The Luhn algorithm is a checksum formula designed to validate various identification numbers, including credit card numbers. Here's how it works:

1. **Input**: Accepts a string of digits representing the credit card number.

2. **Steps**:
   - Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit), double the value of every second digit moving left.
   - If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from the result.
   - Sum all the digits obtained from step 2 together with the unaffected digits.
   - If the total modulo 10 equals zero (if the total ends in zero), then the number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm; otherwise, it is not valid.


### Explanation of the Initial Testing Section:

In this section of the README:

- **Initial Testing**: It is mentioned that initial testing has been conducted to verify the expected behavior of the `luhn_check` function.
  
- **Coverage**: It specifies what aspects have been covered in the tests:
  - Validation of known valid credit card numbers.
  - Detection of known invalid credit card numbers.
  - Handling of edge cases, such as non-digit characters in the input.

Including this section helps users and potential collaborators understand that you have conducted tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of your implementation of the Luhn algorithm in Python.
